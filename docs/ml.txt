Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that allows systems to learn and improve automatically from experience without being explicitly programmed. 
It uses algorithms to analyze data, identify patterns, and make predictions. 
Common types include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
