Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science focused on creating machines that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. 
This includes learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and natural language understanding. 
AI can be categorized into narrow AI (specific tasks) and general AI (human-like intelligence).
