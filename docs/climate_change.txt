Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns. 
While natural processes can contribute, human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial emissions have accelerated climate change. 
The impacts include rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and loss of biodiversity.
